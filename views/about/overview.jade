  h2 How does it work?
  ol
    li
      h3 Add an <kbd>after_success</kbd> script to your <kbd>.travis.yml</kbd> file.
      | <code>after_success:
      |  - curl -s "http://www.deployasaur.us/deploy.sh" | bash</code>

    li
      h3 <a href="/login">Log in</a> with your GitHub credentials and create a new deployment script for your repository.
      p Deployment scripts are executed <kbd>./your-script</kbd> style on one of your Travis workers. You can use any language that Travis will understand (be sure to include a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">shebang</a>), and Travis gives your script root access through <kbd>sudo</kbd>.

    li
      h3 Push to your repository!
      p Assuming that you have <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/">Travis CI already configured</a>, pushing to your repository on GitHub will trigger a new build on Travis, and Travis will trigger deployasaurus to run your deployment script if your tests pass. <a href="#{magicUrl}">Like magic</a>!

  h2 Why not just write deployment into <kbd>.travis.yml</kbd>?
  p <em>The <kbd>after_success</kbd> script is run on every travis worker</em> after your tests complete successfully. If you have more than one build configuration (and your build matrix expands into more than one test run), your <kbd>after_success</kbd> script will be run more than once. I don't know about you, but I don't like deploying the same code more than once!
  p <em>Deployasaur.us understands your build matrix</em> and will run your deployment script only once. Check your logs after deploying; some of your travis workers will no-op due to incomplete runs.

  h2 What can I use automatic deployments for?
  p Everything! Deploy a web application to Heroku. Or maybe generate documentation from your source code and deploy it automatically to your repositoryâ€™s GitHub pages.
